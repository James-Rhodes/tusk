 This project is a work in progress. It aims to aid in the development of PL/pgSQL functions by capturing the overall DDL of the DB. I hope it will eventually support:

1. Pulling the DB DDL in with the local DDL.
2. Pushing changes to PL/pgSQL functions to the DB.
3. Testing the validity of PL/pgSQL functions.
4. Maybe a unit testing type framework for PL/pgSQL functions
